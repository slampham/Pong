# Pong
> Use reinforcement learning in order to show a bot how to play Pong!

[comment]: # (put example screenshot here)

## ML Topics Used
* **Algorithm**: Q-learning
* **Technologies**: PyTorch, OpenAI Gym

## Background
This is a final project I completed for my Artifical Intilligence course, which I was tasked with understanding the Q-learning algorithm and implement it myself. After implementing the algorithm, the bot improved its winrate from 30% to 91%! It took roughly 10 hours of training on Google servers to achieve the highest possible results.
